## Inspiration üí°
**HERMES** was inspired by the urgent need to address multiple critical issues plaguing the healthcare industry, with a primary focus on improving the lives of individuals and communities. The following key factors served as driving forces:
1. **Inequity in Healthcare Access:** Across the world, disparities in healthcare access persist, with marginalized communities and underserved populations facing significant hurdles in receiving quality care. *HERMES* aims to bridge this gap by providing a universally accessible and interconnected healthcare system. By leveraging technology and digital records, it ensures that every individual, regardless of their socioeconomic background or geographic location, has access to essential health services.
2. **Fragmented Health Records:** Traditional health records are often fragmented and scattered across different healthcare providers, making it challenging for patients and doctors to access a comprehensive view of a patient's medical history. *HERMES* offers a unified platform where all medical information is consolidated as NFTs, ensuring that health records are complete, up-to-date, and easily accessible to authorized parties. This eliminates the inefficiencies and potential risks associated with incomplete records.
3. **Lack of Doctor-Patient Communication:** Effective communication between patients and healthcare providers is essential for improving health outcomes. The absence of convenient and real-time communication can lead to miscommunication, delayed diagnoses, and suboptimal care. *HERMES* provides a secure channel for seamless communication, enabling patients and doctors to connect, share information, and make informed decisions collaboratively.
4. **Data Security:** Data security and privacy in healthcare are paramount. Breaches in health data can have severe consequences for individuals, leading to identity theft and other potential risks. *HERMES* incorporates blockchain technology to establish a robust security framework, ensuring that personal health data remains confidential and immutable. This inspires trust in the system, making patients more comfortable sharing their information.
5. **Economic Barrier/Divide:** The cost of quality healthcare and medication is a significant economic barrier for many individuals. *HERMES* tackles this issue by fostering connections with pharmacies and specialists, facilitating online consultations, and enabling efficient management of health records. By lowering barriers to access and providing more cost-effective healthcare solutions, *HERMES* contributes to reducing economic disparities in healthcare.

## What it does üè•
**HERMES** is an innovative digital healthcare platform designed to provide a wide range of services and address the complex issues in healthcare. It does the following:
- **Data Storage:** It stores various medical data types, including eye tests, X-rays, vaccines, blood tests, doctor's office notes, wellness checkup records, past appointments, prescription history, and health digital credentials as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the XRP Ledger. An off-chain Cockroach DB is used to efficiently manage and retrieve this data.
- **Data Security:** Data is secured on the blockchain with hash links to the Cockroach DB, ensuring fast access while prioritizing data safety.
- **General Medical Advice and Queries:** Patients can seek general medical advice and ask health-related questions. An AI system powered by OpenAI, with integration through Minds DB, assists in providing accurate and personalized responses.
- **AI Report Summarization and Recommendation:** The platform uses Vectara AI for summarizing medical reports and offering recommendations.
- **Image Disease Diagnosis:** It provides the capability to diagnose diseases from X-rays, scans, and other medical images, along with treatment recommendations.
- **Doctor-Patient Communication:** A video chat system and text communication are integrated, allowing for real-time interaction between doctors and patients. Hume AI is used for analyzing sentiment and tone in the communication.
- **Patient Services Recommendation:** The platform offers recommendations for hospitals, pharmacies, and treatment centers based on the patient's condition and needs.
